# Often in development mode, we retrieve a database from a production server
# using 'attachment_s3' (cloud platform). This script automatically changes
# the attachments to be stored in the database because there is no S3 bucket
# when working in dev.
#
# When one needs to work on S3 with a development instance, he might set the
# ODOO_DEV_KEEP_ATTACHMENT_S3=true environment variable
#
