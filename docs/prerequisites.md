# Prerequisite

Be sure to have a recent version of docker and docker-compose.

1. to install docker, refers to [this
   documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/),
   or kindly ask to someone who will be glad to help you :)
   Also do the optional configuration "Create a Docker group". If it does not
   work, try this command:

        sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker

   and restart the Docker daemon.

2. to install docker-compose, run

        sudo pip install docker-compose
